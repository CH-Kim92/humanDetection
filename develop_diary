#Development log 

Counting person based on the line 

1. Using OpenCV to capture webcam 
2. Select the region I am interested in 
3. Draw line on the display
4. Track objects that are moving (using opencv) **
5. Create mask of the captured object if the size is over than set value (1000) to avoid noise 
`area= cv2.contourArea(cnt)` `area > 1000` 
6. Put text on the display (cv.line) 
7. Trainning own dataset using yolov5 


# Challenging
  * duplicate counting (Tracking object is necessary)
