#Development log 

Counting person based on the line 


1. Using OpenCV to capture webcam 
2. Select the region I am interested in 
3. Draw line on the display
4. Track objects that are moving (using opencv) **
5. Create mask of the captured object if the size is over than set value (1000) to avoid noise 
`area= cv2.contourArea(cnt)` `area > 1000` 
6. Put text on the display (cv.line) 
7. Trainning own dataset using yolov5 
8. Draw circles on a cnetre of objects to count if the circle is above the line 

# Challenging
  * duplicate counting (Tracking object is necessary) 
  * The person hide behind wall, the number is discounted
  
# Idea
 Make a filter that can compare current position of object and previous position. As the property of the way, new person should display the bottom of the line at the first time. 
 So if the circle was below the line and passes the line then count
